# aru's Linux Dotfiles
after a while configuring something something (yeah it's tiring apparently) it's pretty much ready! i'm glad that my workstation on linux are similar to my [windows](https://github.com/akayanuarcandra/windows-dotfiles). and once again this dotfiles is still increcibly messy because i can't really code and i'm still too lazy to clean up some things
